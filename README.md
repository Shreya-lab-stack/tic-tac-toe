# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game with AI (Python)

This is a simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Python as part of my internship with *CodSoft. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm*, making it unbeatable.

## 📌 Task
*Task 2*: Build a Tic Tac Toe game using Python where a human can play against an AI opponent.

---

## 🧠 Features
- AI opponent that never loses (Minimax)
- Simple terminal-based interface
- Single-player mode (You vs Computer)
- Clean code structure and easy to understand

---

## ▶ How to Play
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the file using:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py

3. Choose your moves by entering a number between 1–9:

1 | 2 | 3
-----------
 4 | 5 | 6
-----------
 7 | 8 | 9


4. Try to beat the AI! (Good luck 😅)
